## Current Workflow

### For Customers:
1. **Dashboard** → View active requests & available collectors
2. **Book Collector** → Use booking modal with all required fields
3. **Track Requests** → Monitor status on dashboard or "My Requests" page

### For Collectors:
1. **Dashboard** → View pending requests and assigned requests
2. **Accept Requests** → Click "Accept" on pending requests
3. **Complete Requests** → Click "Mark Complete" on in-progress requests

## Features Removed ❌
- ✗ Separate "Request Pickup" page (`AddWasteRequest` component)
- ✗ Location detection and geolocation API calls
- ✗ "Update Location" functionality
- ✗ Manual location input modals
- ✗ Navigation links to removed features

## Features Enhanced ✅
- ✓ Booking modal handles all request creation
- ✓ Direct collector booking with all required fields
- ✓ Simplified dashboard navigation
- ✓ Clear guidance for users to use booking functionality
- ✓ Streamlined user experience

## Testing Results

✅ **All tests passing** - Comprehensive test created (`test_updated_dashboard.js`) verifying:
- Customer registration and login
- Collector registration and login  
- Available collectors retrieval by city
- Booking flow through modal (simulated API calls)
- Request assignment and status updates
- Accept and complete request functionality

## Benefits of Changes

1. **Simplified UX** - Single booking flow through dashboard
2. **Reduced Complexity** - No separate pages or location handling
3. **Better Performance** - No geolocation API calls or location tracking
4. **Maintainability** - Less code to maintain and debug
5. **User Guidance** - Clear paths for booking with available collectors

The dashboard now provides a clean, streamlined experience where customers can easily book with specific collectors through the booking modal, and all location information is handled through the address input field in the booking form.
