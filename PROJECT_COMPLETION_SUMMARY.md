## 📊 Database Schema (Final)

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  username VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  role VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL CHECK (role IN ('customer', 'collector')),
  first_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
  last_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
  phone VARCHAR(20),
  address TEXT,
  -- Location fields
  country VARCHAR(100),
  state VARCHAR(100),
  city VARCHAR(100),
  -- Collector-specific fields
  collector_group_name VARCHAR(100),
  e_waste_price DECIMAL(10,2),
  plastic_price DECIMAL(10,2),
  organic_price DECIMAL(10,2),
  paper_price DECIMAL(10,2),
  metal_price DECIMAL(10,2),
  glass_price DECIMAL(10,2),

);
```

## 🎯 Unified Waste Types

The system now uses a consistent set of waste types across all components:

1. **E-waste** (Electronic) - 🔌 Blue
2. **Plastic** - ♻️ Green  
3. **Organic** - 🌱 Brown
4. **Paper** - 📄 Orange
5. **Metal** - ⚙️ Gray
6. **Glass** - 🥤 Cyan
7. **Hazardous** - ⚠️ Red
8. **Mixed** - 🗂️ Purple

## 💼 Business Logic

### **For Collectors:**
1. Register with business/group name
2. Set pricing for each waste type they collect
3. Specify their service city
4. Update pricing through profile management
5. Visible to customers in same city (case-insensitive)

### **For Customers:**
1. Register with location information
2. Create waste collection requests
3. View available collectors in their city
4. See collector group names and pricing
5. Make informed decisions based on prices
