# Customer Profile Update Fix Summary

## Problem
- Customer profile updates were failing with 400 Bad Request errors
- Users were being redirected to the login page after attempting profile updates
- The profile data was not being saved to the database

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Frontend Issue**: The Profile component was sending empty strings for collector-specific fields (like `collector_group_name`, `e_waste_price`, etc.) even for customer users
2. **Backend Validation**: The validation middleware was rejecting empty strings for price fields because they failed the `isFloat({ min: 0 })` validation
3. **API Interceptor Issue**: The response interceptor in `api.js` was too aggressive and automatically redirected to login on any 401 error
4. **Inconsistent API Usage**: Redux actions were using raw `axios` instead of the configured `api` instance

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed API Service (`frontend/src/services/api.js`)
- Modified the response interceptor to be less aggressive
- Only auto-redirect for critical auth failures, not for profile/verify endpoints
- Let Redux actions handle 401 errors gracefully

### 2. Updated Redux Actions (`frontend/src/redux/actions/authActions.js`)
- Changed from using raw `axios` to using the configured `api` instance
- This ensures proper authorization headers and interceptor handling
- Simplified token management since the `api` interceptor handles it

### 3. Fixed Profile Component (`frontend/src/components/Profile.jsx`)
- Modified `handleSubmit` to filter out collector-specific fields for customers
- Only sends collector fields if user role is 'collector' AND fields have valid values
- For price fields, validates they are numeric before including them
- Completely excludes empty collector fields instead of sending empty strings

## Key Changes

### Before (Problematic):
```javascript
// Sent ALL fields including empty collector fields for customers
const submitData = {
  first_name: "John",
  last_name: "Doe",
  // ... other fields ...
  collector_group_name: "",  // Empty string causes validation error
  e_waste_price: "",         // Empty string causes validation error
  plastic_price: "",         // Empty string causes validation error
  // ... more empty collector fields
};
```

### After (Fixed):
```javascript
// For customers - only sends customer fields
const submitData = {
  first_name: "John", 
  last_name: "Doe",
  phone: "+1234567890",
  address: "123 Main St",
  country: "USA",
  state: "CA", 
  city: "San Francisco"
  // No collector fields included at all
};

// For collectors - only includes collector fields with valid values
if (user.role === 'collector') {
  if (values.collector_group_name?.trim()) {
    submitData.collector_group_name = values.collector_group_name.trim();
  }
  // Only include numeric price fields
  if (values.e_waste_price && !isNaN(values.e_waste_price)) {
    submitData.e_waste_price = parseFloat(values.e_waste_price);
  }
}
```

## Testing Results
✅ Customer profile updates now work correctly  
✅ Data is properly saved to the database  
✅ Users remain logged in after profile updates  
✅ Token validation continues to work after updates  
✅ Collector profiles with valid data still work  
✅ Invalid collector data is properly rejected with validation errors  

## Files Modified
1. `frontend/src/services/api.js` - Fixed aggressive response interceptor
2. `frontend/src/redux/actions/authActions.js` - Use api instance instead of axios
3. `frontend/src/components/Profile.jsx` - Filter collector fields for customers

## Verification
The fix has been tested with both backend API tests and frontend integration. Customer profile updates now work correctly without causing logouts or database save failures.
